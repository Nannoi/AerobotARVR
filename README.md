# AerobotVR

## Aerobot is a versatile soft robotics project designed for creating temporary structures that can adapt to changing conditions. Its unique combination of lightweight materials and a sophisticated material actuation system allows users to design their own flexible spaces.

The challenge of this project was to make the application interactive and tailored to user needs, while maintaining accurate perception. I was involved in developing the last two versions, building upon the first version and incorporating additional functions such as real-time interaction, AR/VR capabilities, and control via speech or touch screen.

This is an Virtual reality software controled by dropdown menu and mobile joystick.
